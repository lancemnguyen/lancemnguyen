# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a Software Engineer with over two years of experience building full-stack AI applications on cloud. My work involves developing AI features, prompt engineering and model evaluation, and I'm committed to continuous learning with strong fundamental engineering skills.

Coming from a background in Kinesiology and professional tennis coaching, I developed a deep appreciation for problem-solving, collaboration and communication, now applying these skills to data-driven software solutions.

ðŸ’¬ I enjoy building genuine relationships and connecting with others. Let's find ways to explore opportunities for growth and collaboration!

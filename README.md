# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a Software Engineer specializing in building cloud-native AI applications, fine-tuning models, and optimizing agentic and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows. My passion lies in AI research, prompt engineering, and automation, with over two years of experience in full-stack development and model evaluation. I'm committed to continuous learning and having strong foundational programming skills.

Coming from a background in Kinesiology and professional tennis coaching, I developed a deep appreciation for data analysis, problem-solving, and effective communication, skills that I now apply to data-driven software solutions.

ðŸ’¬ I enjoy building genuine relationships and connecting with others. Let's find ways to explore opportunities for growth and collaboration!
